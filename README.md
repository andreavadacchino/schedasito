# Schedasito React App

This project was bootstrapped with **Vite** and rewritten using React functional components.
Temporary data is loaded from JSON files in `public/data/`. All fetch calls resolve paths relative to `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` so the app works when served from a subdirectory. These files can be replaced with real API endpoints later.

The UI is styled using **Tailwind CSS**.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start the development server using `npm run dev` and open the printed URL in your browser.
3. Build a production bundle with `npm run build` and preview it using `npm run preview`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server with hot reload.
- `npm run build` – create a production build in the `dist` folder.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production bundle locally.
