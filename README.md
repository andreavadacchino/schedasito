# Schedasito React App

This project was bootstrapped with **Vite** and rewritten using React functional components.
Temporary data is loaded from JSON files inside `public/data/` and can be replaced with real API endpoints later.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server with hot reload.
- `npm run build` – create a production build in the `dist` folder.
